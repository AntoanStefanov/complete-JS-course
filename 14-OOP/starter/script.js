// 206. What is Object-Oriented Programming?

// A class itself is not an object.
// chertej za kushta -> realna kushta.
// Shablon(class) -> Obekt(instance/real object/)
// blueprint -> instance

// The beauty of this, is that we can use this blueprint
// to create as many instances/objects/ as we want.

// these instances/objects/ can have different data/properties/,
// but they share the same functionality/methods/.
