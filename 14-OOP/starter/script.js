// 206. What is Object-Oriented Programming?

// A class itself is not an object.
// chertej za kushta -> realna kushta.
// Shablon(class) -> Obekt(instance/real object/)
// blueprint -> instance

// The beauty of this, is that we can use this blueprint
// to create as many instances/objects/ as we want.

// these instances/objects/ can have different data/properties/,
// but they share the same functionality/methods/.

// How do we actually design a class?
// How do we model real-world data into classes?

// Like an architecture student, asking:
// "How do we actually plan and design a house?"

// The answer is NOT straightforward.
// There is NO single correct way of designing classes.

// There are, however, 4 fundamental principles of OOP()
// There are, however, 4 fundamental principles that
// can guide us towards a good class implementation.

// Abstraction | Encapsulation | Inheritance | Polymorphism

// These techniques can actually be used outside of OOP,
// but they are especially relevant in this context.
