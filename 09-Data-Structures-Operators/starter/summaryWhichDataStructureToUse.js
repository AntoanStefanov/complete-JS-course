// Dealing and working with data is the main thing we do as DEVs.

// We have been working with JS built-in data structures,
// First, we learned about Arrays & Objects.
// Second, we learned about Sets & Maps.

// Now, we have 4 data structures from which we can choose.

// Let's see the prons & cons of each data structure,
// Let's see when to choose each of them.

// Where data can actually come from?
// UI -> user interface/the webpage.
// 3 sources of data.

// 1. From the program itself: Data written directly in source code/status messg
// 2. From the UI: Data input from the user or data written in DOM/tasks in todo
// 3. From external sources: Data fetched e.g. from web API/e.g. recipe objects/

// Web API -> Aplication Programming Interface, we can use web API, to get data,
// from other web applications.
// E.g. We could use a web API to get the current weather in any city or data
// about movies, or anything you want.

// So, no matter where the data comes from or what kind of data it is.
// We usually always have collections of data, that we then, need to store
// somewhere.

// So, where do we store collections of data ? Answer: DATA STRUCTURES.
