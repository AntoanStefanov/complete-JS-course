                                              Destructuring is an ES6 feature.                                                

                              Way on unpacking values from an array or an object into seperate variables.

                    Destructuring is to break complex data structure down into a smaller data structure like a variable.

            For arrays, we use destructuring to retrieve elements from the array and store them into variables in a very easy way.
