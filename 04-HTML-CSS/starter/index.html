    <!-- paragraph -->
    <p class="first-p">
      You can learn JavaScript without HTML and CSS, but for DOM manipulation
      it's useful to have some basic ideas of HTML & CSS.
      <!-- an attribute, describes element -->
      <!-- https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp -->
      <!-- Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value" -->
      <!-- href attribute (hyper) -->
      You can learn more with <a href="https://google.bg">Google</a>.
      <!-- the link is right in line with the previous text(p tag - text)
      that's why we call the anchor element an inline element.
      so, it flows inline with the rest of the text. -->
    </p>
    <!-- this h2 element is a block element.
    because as we see, the h2 is NOT inline with the text of the previous element.
    it created a new line which only contains the h2 content.
    huge block. -->
    <h2>Another heading</h2>
    <!-- We will use the class to select the paragraph for style. -->
    <p class="second-p">Just another paragraph.</p>
    <!-- source attribute -->
    <img
      id="google-image"
      src="https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/00Cx7vFIetxCuKxQeqPf8mi-66.fit_lim.size_1050x.jpg"
      alt=""
      width="300px" height="300px"
    />
    <!-- ctrl + S (save) => "/" is added at the end of the img tag,
    that's beacuse the image element does not have a closing tag.
    it only has an opening tag, so we close the opening tag by the end with "/",
    it has NO closing tag, because we dont put any text or smth between the open and close tags.
    ex. <img src="lala"> NO TEST HERE </img> -> no such thing.
    that's why it is made as a self closing tag. 
    it's called SELF-CLOSING TAG.-->

    <!-- As u see different elements, have different attributes. -->

    <!-- There are two important attributees that we can use on ALL elements,
    and we use these attrs to identify the elements, called 'class' and 'id'.
    We use classes and ids to essentially name elements, so that we can select them in CSS.
    In order to style them. We also use use ids and classes to select elements from JS for DOM manipulation.
    Crucial attributes, especially classes.
   -->

    <!-- Difference between classes and ids is that IDs have to be unique.
    Each ID can be used ONCE on the page,
    while classes can be used over and over again.
    I cannot have another element with id "google-image".
    But I can have another paragraph with class "secondP".
    In practice we almost never user IDs to style or select them from JS.
    Better practice to use classes.  -->

    <!-- HTML form -->
    <!-- Introduction of the idea of basically creating boxes. -->
    <!-- So we want the content of this form to be in a box. -->
    <!-- There are many ways of creating boxes in HTML. -->
    <!-- The most generic box is a div. -->
    <!-- Giving it a name, using id -->
    <!-- id="your-name" because that's what we gonna do in this form. -->
    <!-- just an input asking for the user's name, basically. -->
    <!-- For the id/class names in CSS we use DASH(-) for words seperation. -->
    <!-- In JS, we would use camelCase, but CSS convetion is "word-one-word-two" -->
    <!-- "Basically a form" ? But what about the form tag? hmmm :? -->
    <form id="your-name">
      <h2>Your name here</h2>
      <p>Please fill in this form</p>
      <!-- type attribute specifies the type of data that should be inputted into this element -->
      <!-- placeholder attr. -->
      <input type="text" placeholder="Your name" />
      <!-- input -> one of the elements with NO closing tag. it's a SELF-CLOSING tag. -->
      <!-- usually a form also has a butoon -->
      <button>Submit</button>
      <!-- nothing will happen on submit, bcs we would need some JS for that. -->
    </form>
    <!-- he describes this div tag as a form. What about form tag? -->
    <!-- At the end of the lecture he replaced div tag with form -->
    <!-- Form contains some input/s and button elements. -->
    <!-- using form tag instead of div tag is more semantic -->
    <!-- semantic -> a tag that describes better the content that holds itself. -->
    <!-- better 'form' than 'div', which (div) is just a generic box. -->
    <!-- div el is just a generic box which has no meaning at all. -->
    <!-- Not good for many reasons, ex. for SEO.  -->
    <!-- When Google searches your page, it's better if it knows exactly what each element means -->
    <!-- than just having generic boxes without any meaning at all. -->
    <!-- Using the appropriate element, according to the content that's in it
    is the idea of semantic HTML. -->
    <!-- In this case we are creating a form, bcs we have input and a button,
    so we use the form tag, that HTML givus us, just for this purpose. -->
