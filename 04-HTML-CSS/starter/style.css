/* 
We use CSS to style elements,
to create a layout for the overall page.
оформление за цялата страница

We seperated the presentation from the content.

We write CSS in external CSS file.
To style elements, we need to first select them. 
There are different types of selectors in CSS.
Most basic selector is the 'element selector',
with 'element selector' we can select all elements of a certain type,
ex. 'body'
that's body element selector (body), {...} -> declaration block,
bg-color: green -> simple declaration,
property: value */
body {
  /* here we write the CSS declarations. */
  /* property name : value */
  background-color: rgb(244, 244, 122);
  /* IN practice, we use web fonts, ex. from a service like Google Fonts */
  font-family: Arial;
  /* We set the font-family on the body,
    why other elements like the h1 got Arial as font too ?
    That's because the font family property is a property that GETS INHERITED.
    All child elements of the body element will automatically get the font assigned to them.
    That's handy because we dont need to set the font seperately on all these elements.
    setting font on the body, the font will be set on all the child elements.   */

  /* Most properties actually do NOT get inherited */
  /* But generally, all the properties related to fonts will be inherited. */

  font-size: 20px;
  /* 
  it all got a little bigger, HOWEVER NOT ALL elements have a font-size of 20px now.
  That's bcs the elements like for ex. h1/h2 have PREDEFINED font-sizes,
  that are automatically applied from the browser.
  saw 'user agent stylesheet' in inspect mode where styles are.
  */
}

p {
  color: rgb(244, 5, 5);
}

/* another element selector - h1 */
h1 {
  /* Overwriting the browser predefined font-size */
  font-size: 40px;
}

/* class selector (.class-name) */
.first-p {
  /* we can use it on multiple elements. */
  color: blue;
}

/* id selector */
#your-name {
  /* we use id on ONE element in the html. */
  background-color: rgb(216, 216, 56);
  /* border property is so called "shorthand property", because as value we can set multiple values  */
  /* border: thickness, style, color(is that hex color code?) */
  border: 4px solid #444;
  /* border property is not inherited, bcs if it was inherited, then all child elements in the form,
  would have borders TOO. That wouldn't make sense, that's why border is NOT inherited.  */
}
